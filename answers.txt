CMPUT 404 Lab 4 Answers

1. Question 1
-  Git URL: https://github.com/david-parise/CMPUT404F22-lab-4.git

2. Question 2
-  The browser shows a django page at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ saying "The install worked successfully! Congratulations!".
   The page also includes links to Django Documentation, Tutorial: A Polling App, and Django Community.

3. Question 3
-  Navigating to / displays a 404 page, whereas navigating to /polls displays a page with 
   "Hello, world. You're at the polls index." printed.

4. Question 4
-  Migrations are Django's way of propagating changes you make to your models, such as adding a field, deleting a model, etc.
   into your database schema.

5. Question 5
-  After logging into the Django administration site, we can access Groups and Users under the Authentication and Authorization section,
   and our custom models, Choices and Questions, under the Polls section. We can also view our recent actions.
   We can get custom models to appear in the Django admin page by registering them in admin.py.

6. Question 6
-  At /polls/38/ we see "You're looking at question 38." At /polls/38/results/ we see "You're looking at the results of question 38."
   And finally at /polls/38/vote we see "You're voting on question 38." If we use a string instead of an index, we get a 404 page 
   because Django expects an integer for question_id. To allow arbitrary alphabetic characters, we can change the type of question_id
   (in the urls.py file) from int to str.
